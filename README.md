Hey, I'm east, a learning amateur programmer. <br>
Some of my interests include <i>privacy, Linux/BSD, and data hoarding / archival.

I'm migrating to mainly use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/east "east on codeberg") <br>
All of my projects and future projects will be 1:1 and mirrored with each other for archival purposes, <br> *but* I intend to do a majority of my development on codeberg. I encourage you to do the same!
> "Why migrate?"

Mainly moral reasons, codeberg is a community driven, non-profit, libre git platform.
